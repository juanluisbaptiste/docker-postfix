**Reporting a bug**

First of all, this is **not** a problem reporting forum, only report if you are pretty sure what you are experiencing is a bug with this image, not a configuration issue, for that you can use the [Github discussions section](https://github.com/juanluisbaptiste/docker-postfix/discussions) and we will do our best to help you to figure out what's going on with your setup.

Also be sure you are using the latest image by doing _docker pull juanluisbaptiste/postfix:latest_.
